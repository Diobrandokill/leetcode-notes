### [0721. Accounts Merge](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/accounts-merge/)

#### 问题描述
Given a list accounts, each element accounts[i] is a list of strings, where the first element accounts[i][0] is a name, and the rest of the elements are emails representing emails of the account.

Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some email that is common to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.

After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.

**Example:**
```python
Input:
accounts = [["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john00@mail.com"], ["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"], ["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john_newyork@mail.com"], ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"]]
Output: [["John", 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com'],  ["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"], ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"]]
Explanation:
The first and third John's are the same person as they have the common email "johnsmith@mail.com".
The second John and Mary are different people as none of their email addresses are used by other accounts.
We could return these lists in any order, for example the answer [['Mary', 'mary@mail.com'], ['John', 'johnnybravo@mail.com'],
['John', 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com']] would still be accepted.
```

#### 思路
- 并查集

#### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def accountsMerge(self, accounts: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
        def find(node):
            if parent[node] != node:
                parent[node] = find(parent[node])
            return parent[node]

        def union(x,y):
            root_x,root_y = find(x),find(y)
            if root_x == root_y: return
            parent[root_x] = root_y

        parent = [i for i in range(len(accounts))] # 存储根节点
        groups = {} # 存储名字和邮箱的从属关系
        # 根据并查集找到人名之间的联通关系
        for idx,account in enumerate(accounts):
            mails = account[1:]
            for mail in mails:
                if mail in groups:
                    union(groups[mail],idx)
                else:
                    groups[mail] = idx

        res = []
        mail_set = defaultdict(set)

        # 将同一连通域的邮箱整合到一起
        for idx in range(len(accounts)):
            p_node = find(idx)
            mail_set[p_node] |= set(accounts[idx][1:])
        # print(mail_set)
        # 返回结果
        for idx in mail_set:
            res.append([accounts[idx][0]] + list(sorted(mail_set[idx])))
        return res
```
