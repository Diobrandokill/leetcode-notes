### [684. Redundant Connection](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/redundant-connection/)

#### 问题描述
In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.

The given input is a graph that started as a tree with N nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed.

The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of edges. Each element of edges is a pair [u, v] with u < v, that represents an undirected edge connecting nodes u and v.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of N nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array. The answer edge [u, v] should be in the same format, with u < v.

**Example:**
```python
Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
  1
 / \
2 - 3
```
```python
Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,4], [1,5]]
Output: [1,4]
Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
5 - 1 - 2
    |   |
    4 - 3
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findRedundantConnection(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        def find(node):
            while parent[node] != -1:
                node = parent[node]
            return node
        def union(a,b):
            root_a,root_b = find(a),find(b)
            if root_a == root_b: return [a,b] # 发现环路
            # 按秩合并
            if rank[root_a] > rank[root_b]: root_a,root_b = root_b,root_a
            parent[root_a] = root_b
            # 只有当合并的两个子🌲 秩相同的情况下才会引起新的根节点秩的改变
            if rank[a] == rank[b]: rank[b] += 1

        parent = [-1] * (len(edges)+1)
        rank = [0] * (len(edges)+1)
        for u,v in edges:
            res = union(u,v)
            if res: return res
