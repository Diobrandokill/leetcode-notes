### [0839. Similar String Groups](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/similar-string-groups/)

#### 问题描述
Two strings X and Y are similar if we can swap two letters (in different positions) of X, so that it equals Y. Also two strings X and Y are similar if they are equal.

For example, "tars" and "rats" are similar (swapping at positions 0 and 2), and "rats" and "arts" are similar, but "star" is not similar to "tars", "rats", or "arts".

Together, these form two connected groups by similarity: {"tars", "rats", "arts"} and {"star"}.  Notice that "tars" and "arts" are in the same group even though they are not similar.  Formally, each group is such that a word is in the group if and only if it is similar to at least one other word in the group.

We are given a list strs of strings where every string in strs is an anagram of every other string in strs. How many groups are there?

**Example:**
```python
Input: strs = ["tars","rats","arts","star"]
Output: 2
```
```python
Input: strs = ["omv","ovm"]
Output: 1
```

#### 思路
[并查集求解相似字符串组个数](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/similar-string-groups/solution/yi-kan-jiu-dong-bing-cha-ji-qiu-jie-xian-wugc/)

#### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def numSimilarGroups(self, strs: List[str]) -> int:
        def find(x):
            if parent[x] != x:
                parent[x] = find(parent[x])
            return parent[x]
        def union(a,b):
            if find(a) != find(b): parent[find(a)] = find(b)

        length = len(strs[0])
        n = len(strs)
        parent = [i for i in range(n)]

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i+1,n):
                count = 0
                for c in range(length):
                    if strs[i][c] != strs[j][c]: count += 1
                    if count > 2: break
                if count in (0,2):
                    union(i,j)

        return len([i for i in range(n) if i == parent[i]])
