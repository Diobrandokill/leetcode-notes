### [0191. Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)

#### 问题描述
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Note:

Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 3, the input represents the signed integer. -3.

**Example:**
```python
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
```
```python
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
Output: 1
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.
```
```python
Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output: 31
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.
```
#### 思路
- 下面四种方法

#### 代码

```python
# Solution1: 转二进制count 64ms
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        return bin(n).count('1')

# Solution2: 取余除二count 36ms
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while n:
            if n % 2 == 1: count += 1
            n //= 2
        return count

# Solution3: 右移代替除法
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        for _ in range(32):
            res += n & 1
            n >>= 1
        return res

# Solution4: n&n-1每次消去最右侧的1
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        while n:
            res += 1
            n &= n-1
        return res
```
