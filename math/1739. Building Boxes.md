### [1739. Building Boxes](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/building-boxes/)

#### 问题描述
You have a cubic storeroom where the width, length, and height of the room are all equal to n units. You are asked to place n boxes in this room where each box is a cube of unit side length. There are however some rules to placing the boxes:

You can place the boxes anywhere on the floor.
If box x is placed on top of the box y, then each side of the four vertical sides of the box y must either be adjacent to another box or to a wall.
Given an integer n, return the minimum possible number of boxes touching the floor.

**Example:**

```python
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The figure above is for the placement of the three boxes.
These boxes are placed in the corner of the room, where the corner is on the left side.
```

#### 思路
[放置盒子](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/building-boxes/solution/yi-kan-jiu-dong-fang-zhi-he-zi-python-by-zmxw/)

#### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumBoxes(self, n: int) -> int:

        base, diff, blocks = 0, 1, 0

        # 计算出盒子数对应的层级
        while True:
            if blocks + base > n: break
            blocks += base
            base += diff
            diff += 1
        res = base - diff + 1

        # 每到达一个小状态接触地面的盒子数+1
        for i in range(1, base-1):
            if blocks + i <= n :
                res += 1
                blocks += i
            else :
                break

        # 若最终发现结果在两个小状态之间，则接触地面的盒子数+1
        return res + 1 if not blocks == n else res
