### [0123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/)

#### 问题描述
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example:**
```python
Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```
```python
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```
```python
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```
```
Input: prices = [1]
Output: 0
```
#### 思路
- 动态规划

#### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if not prices: return 0
        dp0 = 0
        dp1 = -prices[0]    #到最后买了一个
        dp2 = float("-inf") #到最后买了一个，卖了一个
        dp3 = float("-inf") #到最后买了两个，卖了一个
        dp4 = float("-inf") #到最后买了两个，卖了两个

        for i in range(1,len(prices)):
            dp1 = max(dp1,dp0-prices[i])
            dp2 = max(dp2,dp1+prices[i])
            dp3 = max(dp3,dp2-prices[i])
            dp4 = max(dp4,dp3+prices[i])
        return max(dp0,dp2,dp4)
