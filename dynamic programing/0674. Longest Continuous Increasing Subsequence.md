### [0674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/miao/)

#### 问题描述
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence (i.e. subarray). The subsequence must be strictly increasing.

A continuous increasing subsequence is defined by two indices l and r (l < r) such that it is [nums[l], nums[l + 1], ..., nums[r - 1], nums[r]] and for each l <= i < r, nums[i] < nums[i + 1].

**Example:**
```python
Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5] with length 3.
Even though [1,3,5,7] is an increasing subsequence, it is not continuous as elements 5 and 7 are separated by element
4.
```
```python
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2] with length 1. Note that it must be strictly
increasing.
```

```python
class Solution1:
    def findLengthOfLCIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(nums):
            tmp = 1
            j = i+1
            while j < len(nums) and nums[j] > nums[j-1]:
                tmp += 1
                j += 1
            res = max(tmp,res)
            i += 1
        return res
```
```python
class Solution2:
    def findLengthOfLCIS(self, nums:list[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        if not n: return 0
        dp = [1] * (n)
        for i in range(n-1):
            if nums[i+1] > nums[i]:dp[i+1] = dp[i] + 1
        return max(dp)
