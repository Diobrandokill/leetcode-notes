### [0518. Coin Change 2](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/coin-change-2/)

#### 问题描述
You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.

**Example:**
```python
Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1
```
```python
Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
```
#### 思路
- 动态规划
- 硬币循环在外面防止重复排序

#### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [1] + [0] * amount
        for coin in coins:
            for i in range(amount - coin + 1):
                if dp[i]:
                    dp[i + coin] += dp[i]
        return dp[amount]
```
