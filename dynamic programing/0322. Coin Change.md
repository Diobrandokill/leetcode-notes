### [0322. Coin Change](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/coin-change/)

#### 问题描述
You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

**Example:**
```python
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```
```python
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
```
```python
Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
Output: 0
```
```python
Input: coins = [1], amount = 1
Output: 1
Example 5:
```
```python
Input: coins = [1], amount = 2
Output: 2
```

#### 思路
- dp
- 状态变换条件为`coin <= i and dp[i - coin] + 1 < dp[i]`

#### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        n = amount
        dp = [float("inf")] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 0
        for i in range(1,n + 1):
            for coin in coins:
                if coin <= i and dp[i - coin] + 1 < dp[i]:
                    dp[i] = dp[i - coin] + 1
        return dp[n] if dp[n] != float("inf") else -1
```
