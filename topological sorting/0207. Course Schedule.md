### [0207. Course Schedule](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/course-schedule/)

#### 问题描述
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

**Example:**
```python
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```
```python
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```
#### 思路
- 拓扑排序
- 建立图 + 维护入度的dict
- 排序方法使用BFS（队列）
- 从入度为0的node开始排序，出一个node，与其相邻的node的入度便剪1，直到找不到入度为0的node

#### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        graph = [[] for _ in range(numCourses)]
        indegrees = {}
        count = 0
        # 建立图 + 入度dict
        for cur,pre in prerequisites:
            if cur not in indegrees:
                indegrees[cur] = 1
            else: indegrees[cur] += 1
            graph[pre].append(cur)
        # BFS队列
        q = collections.deque([node for node in range(numCourses) if node not in indegrees])
        while q:
            tmp = q.popleft()
            count += 1
            for node in graph[tmp]:
                indegrees[node] -= 1 # 相邻node入度-1
                if not indegrees[node]: q.append(node)
        return count == numCourses # 判断是否所有都排了
```
