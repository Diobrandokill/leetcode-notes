### [0444. Sequence Reconstruction](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/sequence-reconstruction/)

#### 问题描述
Check whether the original sequence org can be uniquely reconstructed from the sequences in seqs. The org sequence is a permutation of the integers from 1 to n, with 1 ≤ n ≤ 104. Reconstruction means building a shortest common supersequence of the sequences in seqs (i.e., a shortest sequence so that all sequences in seqs are subsequences of it). Determine whether there is only one sequence that can be reconstructed from seqs and it is the org sequence.

**Example:**
```python
Input: org = [1,2,3], seqs = [[1,2],[1,3]]
Output: false
Explanation: [1,2,3] is not the only one sequence that can be reconstructed, because [1,3,2] is also a valid sequence that can be reconstructed.
```
```python
Input: org = [1,2,3], seqs = [[1,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: The reconstructed sequence can only be [1,2].
```
```python
Input: org = [1,2,3], seqs = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: true
Explanation: The sequences [1,2], [1,3], and [2,3] can uniquely reconstruct the original sequence [1,2,3].
```
```python
Input: org = [4,1,5,2,6,3], seqs = [[5,2,6,3],[4,1,5,2]]
Output: true
```

#### 思路
- 拓扑排序

#### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def sequenceReconstruction(self, org: List[int], seqs: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        if not seqs: return False
        indegrees = collections.defaultdict(int)
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        num_set = set()
        for seq in seqs:
            num_set |= set(seq) # 记录seqs中的数字集合
            for i in range(len(seq)-1):
                graph[seq[i]].append(seq[i+1]) # 链接图
                indegrees[seq[i+1]] += 1 # 入度

        # 若数字集合与org长度不等或不一致，直接返回False
        if len(num_set) != len(org) or set(org) != num_set: return False

        # 通过BFS排序
        q = collections.deque([node for node in num_set if node not in indegrees])
        res = []
        while q:
            if len(q) > 1: return False # 若同一层有不止一个则说明结果不唯一
            tmp = q.popleft()
            res.append(tmp)
            if tmp in graph:
                for node in graph[tmp]:
                    indegrees[node] -= 1
                    if not indegrees[node]:
                        q.append(node)
        return res == org # 判断是否生成的唯一顺序res与org一致
```
