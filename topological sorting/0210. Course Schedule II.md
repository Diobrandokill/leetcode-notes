### [0210. Course Schedule II](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/)

#### 问题描述
There are a total of n courses you have to take labelled from 0 to n - 1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example, if prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] this means you must take the course bi before the course ai.

Given the total number of courses numCourses and a list of the prerequisite pairs, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.

If there are many valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

**Example:**
```python
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].
```
```python
Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].
```
```python
Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
Output: [0]
```
#### 思路
- 拓扑排序，与 [0207. Course Schedule]() 基本相同
#### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def findOrder(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        res = []
        indegrees = {}
        graph = [[] for _ in range(numCourses)]
        for cur,pre in prerequisites:
            if cur not in indegrees: indegrees[cur] = 1
            else: indegrees[cur] += 1
            graph[pre].append(cur)
        q = collections.deque([node for node in range(numCourses) if node not in indegrees])
        while q:
            tmp = q.popleft()
            res.append(tmp)
            for node in graph[tmp]:
                indegrees[node] -= 1
                if not indegrees[node]: q.append(node)
        return res if len(res) == numCourses else []
```
