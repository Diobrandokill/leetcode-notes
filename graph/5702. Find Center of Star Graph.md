### [5702. Find Center of Star Graph](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/find-center-of-star-graph/)

#### 问题描述
There is an undirected star graph consisting of n nodes labeled from 1 to n. A star graph is a graph where there is one center node and exactly n - 1 edges that connect the center node with every other node.

You are given a 2D integer array edges where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an edge between the nodes ui and vi. Return the center of the given star graph.

**Example:**
```python
Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: As shown in the figure above, node 2 is connected to every other node, so 2 is the center.
```
```python
Input: edges = [[1,2],[5,1],[1,3],[1,4]]
Output: 1
```

#### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def findCenter(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        return edges[0][0] if edges[0][0] in edges[1] else edges[0][1]
```
```python
class Solution:
    def findCenter(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        indegrees = collections.defaultdict(int)
        for u,v in edges:
            indegrees[u] += 1
            indegrees[v] += 1
        for node in indegrees:
            if indegrees[node] == len(edges): return node
