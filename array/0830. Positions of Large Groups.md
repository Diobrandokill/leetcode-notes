### [0830. Positions of Large Groups](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/positions-of-large-groups/)

#### 问题描述
In a string s of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character.

For example, a string like s = "abbxxxxzyy" has the groups "a", "bb", "xxxx", "z", and "yy".

A group is identified by an interval [start, end], where start and end denote the start and end indices (inclusive) of the group. In the above example, "xxxx" has the interval [3,6].

A group is considered large if it has 3 or more characters.

Return the intervals of every large group sorted in increasing order by start index.

**Example:**
```python
Input: s = "abbxxxxzzy"
Output: [[3,6]]
Explanation: "xxxx" is the only large group with start index 3 and end index 6.
```
```python
Input: s = "abc"
Output: []
Explanation: We have groups "a", "b", and "c", none of which are large groups.
```
```python
Input: s = "abcdddeeeeaabbbcd"
Output: [[3,5],[6,9],[12,14]]
Explanation: The large groups are "ddd", "eeee", and "bbb".
```

#### 思路
- 一次遍历，双指针

#### 代码
```python
class Solution:
    def largeGroupPositions(self, s: str) -> List[List[int]]:
        if len(s) <= 2: return []
        res,i = [],0
        while i < len(s):
            j = i
            while i < len(s) and s[i] == s[j]: i += 1
            if i-j >= 3: res.append([j,i-1])
        return res

```
