### [1773. Count Items Matching a Rule](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/count-items-matching-a-rule/)

#### 问题描述
You are given an array items, where each items[i] = [typei, colori, namei] describes the type, color, and name of the ith item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, ruleKey and ruleValue.

The ith item is said to match the rule if one of the following is true:

ruleKey == "type" and ruleValue == typei.
ruleKey == "color" and ruleValue == colori.
ruleKey == "name" and ruleValue == namei.
Return the number of items that match the given rule.

**Example:**
```python
Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "color", ruleValue = "silver"
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one item matching the given rule, which is ["computer","silver","lenovo"].
```
```python
Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","phone"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "type", ruleValue = "phone"
Output: 2
Explanation: There are only two items matching the given rule, which are ["phone","blue","pixel"] and ["phone","gold","iphone"]. Note that the item ["computer","silver","phone"] does not match.
```

        count = 0
        if ruleKey == "type":
            for item in items:
                if item[0] == ruleValue: count += 1
        elif ruleKey == "color":
            for item in items:
                if item[1] == ruleValue: count += 1
        else:
            for item in items:
                if item[2] == ruleValue: count += 1
        return count
