### [1798. Maximum Number of Consecutive Values You Can Make](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/maximum-number-of-consecutive-values-you-can-make/)

#### 问题描述
You are given an integer array coins of length n which represents the n coins that you own. The value of the ith coin is coins[i]. You can make some value x if you can choose some of your n coins such that their values sum up to x.

Return the maximum number of consecutive integer values that you can make with your coins starting from and including 0.

Note that you may have multiple coins of the same value.

**Example:**
```python
Input: coins = [1,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: You can make the following values:
- 0: take []
- 1: take [1]
You can make 2 consecutive integer values starting from 0.
```
```python
Input: coins = [1,1,1,4]
Output: 8
Explanation: You can make the following values:
- 0: take []
- 1: take [1]
- 2: take [1,1]
- 3: take [1,1,1]
- 4: take [4]
- 5: take [4,1]
- 6: take [4,1,1]
- 7: take [4,1,1,1]
You can make 8 consecutive integer values starting from 0.
```
```python
Input: nums = [1,4,10,3,1]
Output: 20
```
