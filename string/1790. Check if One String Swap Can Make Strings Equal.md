### [5701. Check if One String Swap Can Make Strings Equal](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/check-if-one-string-swap-can-make-strings-equal/)

#### 问题描述
You are given two strings s1 and s2 of equal length. A string swap is an operation where you choose two indices in a string (not necessarily different) and swap the characters at these indices.

Return true if it is possible to make both strings equal by performing at most one string swap on exactly one of the strings. Otherwise, return false.

**Example:**
```python
Input: s1 = "bank", s2 = "kanb"
Output: true
Explanation: For example, swap the first character with the last character of s2 to make "bank".
```
```python
Input: s1 = "attack", s2 = "defend"
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to make them equal with one string swap.
```
```python
Input: s1 = "kelb", s2 = "kelb"
Output: true
Explanation: The two strings are already equal, so no string swap operation is required.
```
```python
Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "dcba"
Output: false
```

#### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def areAlmostEqual(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        if set(s1) != set(s2): return False
        mark = 0
        for i in range(len(s1)):
            if s1[i] != s2[i]: mark += 1
            if mark > 2: return False
        return True
```
