### [面试题 01.06. Compress String LCCI](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/compress-string-lcci/)

#### 问题描述
Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z).

**Example:**
```python
Input: "aabcccccaaa"
Output: "a2b1c5a3"
```
```python
Input: "abbccd"
Output: "abbccd"
Explanation:
The compressed string is "a1b2c2d1", which is longer than the original string.
```

#### 思路
- 双指针遍历

#### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def compressString(self, S: str) -> str:
        res = ""
        i = 0
        length = len(S)
        while i < length:
            j = i + 1
            while j < length and S[i] == S[j]: j += 1
            res += S[i] + str(j-i)
            i = j
        return res if len(res) < length else S
```
