### [0424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/miao/)

#### 问题描述
Given a string s that consists of only uppercase English letters, you can perform at most k operations on that string.

In one operation, you can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character.

Find the length of the longest sub-string containing all repeating letters you can get after performing the above operations.

Note:
Both the string's length and k will not exceed 104.

**Example:**
```python
Input:
s = "ABAB", k = 2

Output:
4

Explanation:
Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
```
```python
Input:
s = "AABABBA", k = 1

Output:
4

Explanation:
Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
```

```python
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        l,r = 0,0
        res = 0
        counter = collections.Counter()
        while r < len(s):
            counter[s[r]] += 1
            # 当非最多个数字符的字符个数超过k时，左指针右移直到满足要求
            while r - l + 1 - counter.most_common(1)[0][1] > k:
                counter[s[l]] -= 1
                l += 1
            res = max(res,r-l+1)
            r += 1
        return res
