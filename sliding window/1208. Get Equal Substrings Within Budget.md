### [1208. Get Equal Substrings Within Budget](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/get-equal-substrings-within-budget/)

#### 问题描述
You are given two strings s and t of the same length. You want to change s to t. Changing the i-th character of s to i-th character of t costs |s[i] - t[i]| that is, the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters.

You are also given an integer maxCost.

Return the maximum length of a substring of s that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of twith a cost less than or equal to maxCost.

If there is no substring from s that can be changed to its corresponding substring from t, return 0.

**Example:**
```python
Input: s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: "abc" of s can change to "bcd". That costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.
```
```python
Input: s = "abcd", t = "cdef", maxCost = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: Each character in s costs 2 to change to charactor in t, so the maximum length is 1.
```
```python
Input: s = "abcd", t = "acde", maxCost = 0
Output: 1
Explanation: You can't make any change, so the maximum length is 1.
```
#### 思路
[只增大不减小的滑动窗口](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/get-equal-substrings-within-budget/solution/yi-kan-jiu-dong-zhi-zeng-da-bu-jian-xiao-agj5/)

#### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def equalSubstring(self, s: str, t: str, maxCost: int) -> int:

        # 预先计算好所有的cost，减少计算次数
        cost = [0]*len(s)
        for i in range(len(s)):
            cost[i] = abs(ord(t[i]) - ord(s[i]))

        # 只放大不缩小的滑动窗口
        left,right,tmpcost = 0,0,0
        for right in range(len(s)):
            tmpcost += cost[right]
            if tmpcost > maxCost: # 使用if而不是while节省时间
                tmpcost -= cost[left]
                left += 1

        return right - left + 1
```
