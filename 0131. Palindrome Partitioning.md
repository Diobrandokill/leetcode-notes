### [0131. Palindrome Partitioning](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning/)

#### 问题描述
Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of s.

A palindrome string is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

**Example:**
```python
Input: s = "aab"
Output: [["a","a","b"],["aa","b"]]
```
```python
Input: s = "a"
Output: [["a"]]
```
