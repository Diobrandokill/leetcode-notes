### [1743. Restore the Array From Adjacent Pairs](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/restore-the-array-from-adjacent-pairs/)

#### 问题描述
There is an integer array nums that consists of n unique elements, but you have forgotten it. However, you do remember every pair of adjacent elements in nums.

You are given a 2D integer array adjacentPairs of size n - 1 where each adjacentPairs[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that the elements ui and vi are adjacent in nums.

It is guaranteed that every adjacent pair of elements nums[i] and nums[i+1] will exist in adjacentPairs, either as [nums[i], nums[i+1]] or [nums[i+1], nums[i]]. The pairs can appear in any order.

Return the original array nums. If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.

**Example:**
```python
Input: adjacentPairs = [[2,1],[3,4],[3,2]]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
Explanation: This array has all its adjacent pairs in adjacentPairs.
Notice that adjacentPairs[i] may not be in left-to-right order.
```
```python
Input: adjacentPairs = [[4,-2],[1,4],[-3,1]]
Output: [-2,4,1,-3]
Explanation: There can be negative numbers.
Another solution is [-3,1,4,-2], which would also be accepted.
```

[从相邻元素对还原数组](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/restore-the-array-from-adjacent-pairs/solution/yi-kan-jiu-dong-cong-xiang-lin-yuan-su-d-89t0/)

#### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def restoreArray(self, adjacentPairs: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        # 准备邻接矩阵
        nb = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for u, v in adjacentPairs:
            nb[u].append(v)
            nb[v].append(u)

        # 找一个起点
        for key, nb_num in nb.items():
            if len(nb_num) == 1:
                start = key
                break

        # 根据邻接矩阵连接neighbour
        res = [start]
        pre = start
        cur = nb[start][0]
        while True:
            res.append(cur)
            if len(nb[cur]) > 1:
                pre,cur = cur,nb[cur][0] if nb[cur][0] != pre else nb[cur][1]
            # 当len(nb[p]) == 1时：说明走到了结尾
            else:
                break

        return res
