### [1737. Change Minimum Characters to Satisfy One of Three Conditions](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/change-minimum-characters-to-satisfy-one-of-three-conditions/)

#### 问题描述
You are given two strings a and b that consist of lowercase letters. In one operation, you can change any character in a or b to any lowercase letter.

Your goal is to satisfy one of the following three conditions:

Every letter in a is strictly less than every letter in b in the alphabet.
Every letter in b is strictly less than every letter in a in the alphabet.
Both a and b consist of only one distinct letter.
Return the minimum number of operations needed to achieve your goal.

**Example:**
```python
Input: a = "aba", b = "caa"
Output: 2
Explanation: Consider the best way to make each condition true:
1) Change b to "ccc" in 2 operations, then every letter in a is less than every letter in b.
2) Change a to "bbb" and b to "aaa" in 3 operations, then every letter in b is less than every letter in a.
3) Change a to "aaa" and b to "aaa" in 2 operations, then a and b consist of one distinct letter.
The best way was done in 2 operations (either condition 1 or condition 3).
```
```python
Input: a = "dabadd", b = "cda"
Output: 3
Explanation: The best way is to make condition 1 true by changing b to "eee".
```

#### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def minCharacters(self, a: str, b: str) -> int:
        ca = collections.Counter(a)
        cb = collections.Counter(b)
        cc = ca + cb
        res = len(a) + len(b) - max(cc.values())
        nord = lambda x: ord(x)-97
        for bd in range(nord('a'),nord('z')):
            # res1代表将a改为严格小于b中字母的最少操作数
            # res2代表将b改为严格小于a中字母的最少操作数
            res1,res2 = 0,0
            for c in ca:
                # 若c大于boundary则需要
                if nord(c) > bd:
                    res1 += ca[c]
                else:
                    res2 += ca[c]
            for c in cb:
                if nord(c) > bd:
                    res2 += cb[c]
                else:
                    res1 += cb[c]
            res = min(res,res1,res2)
        return res
