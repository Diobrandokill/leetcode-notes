### [1736. Latest Time by Replacing Hidden Digits](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/latest-time-by-replacing-hidden-digits/)

#### 问题描述
You are given a string time in the form of hh:mm, where some of the digits in the string are hidden (represented by ?).

The valid times are those inclusively between 00:00 and 23:59.

Return the latest valid time you can get from time by replacing the hidden digits.

**Example:**
```python
Input: time = "2?:?0"
Output: "23:50"
Explanation: The latest hour beginning with the digit '2' is 23 and the latest minute ending with the digit '0' is 50.
```
```python
Input: time = "0?:3?"
Output: "09:39"
```
```python
Input: time = "1?:22"
Output: "19:22"
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumTime(self, time: str) -> str:
        time = list(time)
        if time[0] == '?':
            time[0] = '2' if time[1] in ('0','1','2','3','?') else '1'
        if time[1] == '?':
            time[1] = '9' if time[0] in ('0','1') else '3'
        if time[3] == '?': time[3] = '5'
        if time[4] == '?': time[4] = '9'
        return "".join(time)
