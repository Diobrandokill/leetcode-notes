### [0739.Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/daily-temperatures/)

#### 问题描述
Given a list of daily temperatures T, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.

Note: The length of temperatures will be in the range [1, 30000]. Each temperature will be an integer in the range [30, 100].

**Example:**
```python
For example, given the list of temperatures T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73], your output should be [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0].
```

#### 思路
单调栈哦😯
#### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, T: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res,stack = [0]*len(T),[]
        for idx,num in enumerate(T):
            while stack and num > T[stack[-1]]:
                pos = stack.pop()
                res[pos] = idx - pos
            stack.append(idx)
        return res
```
